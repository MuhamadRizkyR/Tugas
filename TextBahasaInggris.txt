Bitcoin is known as a type of cryptocurrency because it uses cryptography to keep it secure. 
There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to (although each record is encrypted). 
All Bitcoin transactions are verified by a massive amount of computing power via a process known as "mining". 
Bitcoin is not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor is an individual bitcoin valuable as a commodity. 
Despite it not being legal tender in most parts of the world, Bitcoin is very popular and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other cryptocurrencies, collectively referred to as altcoins. 
Bitcoin is commonly abbreviated as BTC when traded.
The Bitcoin system is a collection of computers (also referred to as "nodes" or "miners") that all run Bitcoin's code and store its blockchain. 
Figuratively speaking, a blockchain can be thought of as a collection of blocks. 
In each block is a collection of transactions. 
Because all of the computers running the blockchain have the same list of blocks and transactions and can transparently see these new blocks as they're filled with new Bitcoin transactions, no one can cheat the system.
Bitcoin is one of the first digital currencies to use peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to facilitate instant payments. 
The independent individuals and companies who own the governing computing power and participate in the Bitcoin network—Bitcoin "miners"—are in charge of processing the transactions on the blockchain and are motivated by rewards (the release of new Bitcoin) and transaction fees paid in Bitcoin.
